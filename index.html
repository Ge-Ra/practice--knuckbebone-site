    <p><a href="https://www.aroundsquare.com/pages/about" target="blank">AROUNDSQUARE's</a> <strong>Knucklebone</strong> is the original hardbody knuckle roller, make no mistake. This is a simple <em>skill toy</em> that is manipulated with the fingers of one or both hands to perform tricks and patterns, or simply to pass the time. It is very discrete (unless dropped) and can be played in very restricted spaces, and in contexts where other showier skill toys may not be appropriate.</p>

    <p>The <strong>Knucklebone</strong> is very appealing, not only for its elegant form and ergonomic design, but also, for the range of play styles that it enables. The rounded lines are perfect for spinning, flipping, and passing it between the fingers. It can be manipulated very casually and quietly like a <em>worry stone</em>, or can be used to perform a surprising array of freestyle flows, technical tricks, isolations, and even aerials.<br>In the right hands, this toy is capable of complex technical tricks that can entertain for hours.</p>
